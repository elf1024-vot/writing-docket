description: Import filled-in intake spreadsheets (CSV) into the project database. Usage: /novel-import [file]
---

You are importing the writer's filled-in intake spreadsheets and turning each row into a
valid, correctly-linked database entry. The writer entered natural values (names, and
optionally descriptions they chose to write); the schema's keys and links are baked in, so
you generate the ids and resolve the links. You do NOT add or embellish content — you
import exactly what the writer wrote, leaving blank what they left blank.

## Step 1 — Load project context

Read `project.json` (current dir or search upward). Capture `project_slug` (= schema),
`project_path`, `ui_port`. If not found, ask for the project name and locate its folder.

## Step 2 — Find the CSVs

Look in `{{project_path}}\intake\` for `characters.csv`, `locations.csv`, `groups.csv`,
`chapters.csv`. If a specific file was passed as an argument, import only that one.

Process them in dependency order so links resolve: **characters → locations → groups →
chapters.** Skip any file that's missing or unchanged from its example-only state.

For each file: read it, parse the header row to map columns, and **ignore any row whose
first cell starts with `[EXAMPLE]`** (those are the template guides).

## Step 3 — Build rows, generating keys and resolving links

Apply the schema's baked-in relationships — the writer never supplied a key:

- **characters** — `name` is the PK (required; skip rows with no name). Take role,
  display_name, and any descriptive columns the writer filled. Never set `is_minor`.
- **locations** — derive `location_id` from `display_name` (lowercase, spaces→hyphens,
  drop punctuation). Take type/region and any descriptions given.
- **groups** — derive `group_id` from `display_name`. If `leader` is filled, resolve it
  against existing character names (query the DB); if it doesn't match exactly, drop the
  leader to NULL and flag the row. Take the other columns as given.
- **chapters** — keys are `book`, `chapter`, `part` (default part 1). Resolve `pov_char`
  against character names and `location` against location `display_name` → `location_id`;
  drop and flag any that don't resolve. Default `status` to `concept`, `priority` to `MED`
  if blank.

Query existing rows for link resolution:
`docker exec <slug>-postgres psql -U docket_master -d <schema> -t -c "SELECT name FROM <schema>.characters;"`
`docker exec <slug>-postgres psql -U docket_master -d <schema> -t -c "SELECT location_id, display_name FROM <schema>.locations;"`
(Within a single import, a leader/POV may refer to a character being imported in this same
run — resolve against both the DB and the rows you're about to insert.)

## Step 4 — Preview and confirm

Show the writer a per-file summary table of the rows you'll insert, plus a clear list of
anything you dropped (a leader/POV/location that didn't resolve) with the reason. Get a
yes before writing anything.

## Step 5 — Insert safely

For each table, write the INSERTs to `{{project_path}}\postgres\_import.sql`, doubling
single quotes in every text value, including only the columns that have a value. Use the
same `ON CONFLICT (<pk>) DO NOTHING` clause per table so re-importing is safe. Then:

1. `docker cp "<project_path>\postgres\_import.sql" <slug>-postgres:/tmp/_import.sql`
2. `docker exec <slug>-postgres psql -U docket_master -d <schema> -f /tmp/_import.sql`
3. Delete the temp file.

## Step 6 — Report

Per file: rows added vs. skipped (already existed or example), and anything dropped for an
unresolved link. Close with:
"Imported. Open the editors (http://localhost:<ui_port>/) to review, fill in anything you
left blank, and start writing."
